## Welcome to my Twitter Archive Analysis

I have recently started learning R and to get a better grip on it. I decided to use different libraries available to perform different kinds on analysis on my twitter archive.

You learn how to download your twitter archive by using this link.

After download your twitter archive. We'll start with the next steps. In your R file load the libraries and twitter csv file by using the below code.

```r
library(ggplot2)
library(scales)
library(lubridate)

tweets <- read.csv('tweets.csv', stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

The timestamp on each tweet is a string at this point, so letâ€™s use a function from the lubridate package to convert the timestamp to a date-time object. The timestamps are recorded in UTC, so to make more interpretable plots, we need to convert to a different time zone. I am combining all my tweets into one timezone for easier representation.

```r
tweets$timestamp <- ymd_hms(tweets$timestamp)
tweets$timestamp <- with_tz(tweets$timestamp, America/San_Francisco)
```


<H2>Tweets by Year, Month, and Day</H2>

First is a basic histogram showing the distribution of my tweets over time.

```r
ggplot(data = tweets, aes(x = timestamp)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(fill = ..count..)) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  xlab("Time") + ylab("Number of tweets") + 
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "aquamarine2", high = "orange2")
```
